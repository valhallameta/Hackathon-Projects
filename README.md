# HackFS- POAP project
Branch for Hackathon Projects

PROJECT FOR ETHGLOBAL HACKATHON

Name of Hackathon: HackFS

Sponsor Protocol Used: POAP

Project: POAP issuance for Artist DAO

Site: ValhallaMeta.io

Idea: The Artist DAO at the galleries of ValhallaMeta.io can 
only be entered by having a work purchased and hanging in the gallery.
his DAO membership would grant curation and voting rights for 
Artist's Choice Galleries, and are non transferrable. Although we 
do have a custom ERC20 token fully minted and available for 
issuance (TimeCoin) once a dapp for the DAO was built, the POAP route
may be a much cheaper, easier, and convenient way to issue the DAO,
as well as provide a nice token to initial artists.

Needs: 
1.Graphic Design a POAP token (don't get too fancy, make it 
classic, and classy)
2. Decide what network to distribute on? (custom or gnosis)
Goal: Issue a POAP to the 100+ artists as a DAO voting token
